## Usage

To use the Risk Return Analysis jupyter lab notebook simply clone the full repository including resources folder and open the **risk_return_analysis.ipynb.ipynb** file in Jupyter Lab. 

Upon launching risk_return_analysis.ipynb notebook, you will go through all the steps to analyse:

1. Import Data - Import required data and import required libraries.
2. Analyze performance - Analyze the data to determine if any of the portfolios outperform the broader stock market.
3. Analyze volatility - Analyze the volatility of each portfolios/stock and of the bench mark index by using box plots.
4. Analyze risk - Evaluate the risk profile of each portfolio/stock by using the standard deviation and the beta.
5. Analyze risk return profile - Determine the overall risk return of an asset or portfolio by considering the Sharpe ratios for each portfolio/stock. 
6. Diversify portfolio - Evaluate how the portfolios/stocks react relative to the broader market and conclude which one(s) can be used to diversify existing portfolio.
